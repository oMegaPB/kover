**Kover** is a object-orientied fully typed mongodb driver supporting local mongod and replica sets. Battle tests are still required*<br>
this library was inspired by <a href=https://github.com/sakal/aiomongo>this project</a> i like it very much. Though its 8 years old.

```py
import asyncio

from kover.client import Kover
from kover.auth import AuthCredentials


async def main():
    # or AuthCredentials.from_environ()
    # (requires MONGO_USER and MONGO_PASSWORD environment variables)
    # (remove if no auth present)
    credentials = AuthCredentials(username="username", password="password")
    kover = await Kover.make_client(credentials=credentials)

    found = await kover.db.test.find().limit(10).to_list()
    print(found)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The main reason why i created this project is that Motor - official async wrapper for mongodb, uses ThreadPool executor and it's just a wrapper around pymongo. In general thats slower than clear asyncio and looks more dirty.
- 02.12.24 UPDATE: pymongo added async support but its kinda slow same as sync version. pymongo's code looks dirty and have lots of unnecessary things. kover almost 2-3 times faster than pymongo.

# Status
it still missing features. <br>
e.g: **bulk write API** and **Compression**<br>
but its already very cool! <br>
ill be happy if someone can help me implement missing features.

# Dependencies
- All platforms.
- pymongo 4.10.1 (latest for now) or later.
- python 3.10.6
- im using MongoDB 7.0 but it should also work on MongoDB 6.0
- attrs 24.2.0 or later for dataclass functionality

# Features
almost all features from pymongo and object-orientied functionality. All auth types are supported.
this lib was built for new MongoDB versions. All features that were marked as DEPRECATED in docs
were NOT added. See docs for references

### Cursors
if you just need list:

```py
items = await db.test.find().limit(1000).batch_size(50).to_list()
```

### or
```py
async with db.test.find().limit(1000).batch_size(50) as cursor:
    async for item in cursor:
        print(item)
```
### if collection has specific schema:
```py
class User(Document):
    uuid: UUID
    name: str
    age: int


async with db.test.find(cls=User).limit(1000) as cursor:
    async for item in cursor:
        print(item) # its now User

```

### Schema Validation
some people say that mongodb is dirty because you can insert any document in collection. Kover fixes that!
```py
import asyncio
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional

from kover.client import Kover
from kover.schema import SchemaGenerator, Document, field


class UserType(Enum):
    ADMIN = "ADMIN"
    USER = "USER"
    CREATOR = "CREATOR"


# can be used as annotation too
class Friend(Document):
    name: str
    age: int = field(min=18)  # minimum age is 18. less will error


# note field_name kwarg in user_type field.
# it'll be name of that key when using .to_dict()
class User(Document):
    name: str = field(description="must be a string")
    age: int = field(
        description="age must be int and more that 18", min=18
    )
    user_type: UserType = field(
        description="can only be one of the enum values",
        field_name="userType"
    )
    friend: Optional[Friend]


async def main():
    kover = await Kover.make_client()

    generator = SchemaGenerator()
    schema = generator.generate(User)

    collection = await kover.db.test.create_if_not_exists()
    await collection.set_validator(schema)

    valid_user = User("John Doe", 20, UserType.USER, friend=Friend("dima", 18))

    # function accepts either valid_user or valid_user.to_dict()
    object_id = await collection.insert(valid_user)
    print(object_id, "added!")

    invalid_user = User(
        "Rick",
        age=15,
        user_type=UserType.ADMIN,
        friend=Friend("roma", 25)
    )
    # kover.exceptions.ErrDocumentValidationFailure: Rick's age is less than 18
    await collection.insert(invalid_user)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

### Transactions

```py
import asyncio

from bson import ObjectId

from kover.client import Kover
from kover.session import Transaction
from kover.typings import xJsonT


async def main():
    kover = await Kover.make_client()
    session = await kover.start_session()

    # specify _id directly
    doc: xJsonT = {"_id": ObjectId(), "name": "John", "age": 30}
    collection = await kover.db.test.create_if_not_exists()

    transaction: Transaction
    async with session.start_transaction() as transaction:
        await collection.insert(doc, transaction=transaction)
        # it should error with duplicate key now
        await collection.insert(doc, transaction=transaction)

    print(transaction.exception, type(transaction.exception))  # if exist
    print(transaction.state)

    found = await collection.find().to_list()
    print(found)  # no documents found due to transaction abort

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

### GridFS

```py
import asyncio

from kover.client import Kover
from kover.gridfs import GridFS
from kover.auth import AuthCredentials


async def main():
    credentials = AuthCredentials.from_environ()
    kover = await Kover.make_client(credentials=credentials)

    database = kover.get_database("files")
    fs = GridFS(database)
    await fs.create_indexes()  # optional make fs collections indexed

    # can be bytes, any type of IO str or path
    file_id = await fs.put(b"Hello World!")

    file, binary = await fs.get_by_file_id(file_id)
    print(file, binary.read())

    files = await fs.list()
    print(f"total files: {len(files)}")

    deleted = await fs.delete(file_id)
    print("is file deleted?", deleted)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```
